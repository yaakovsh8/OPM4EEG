# Accessing External Project Files

Due to GitHub’s 25 MB file size limit, large project assets are hosted on Mega.nz. Follow the steps below to download, extract, and integrate them into this repository.

---

## 1. Download from Mega.nz

1. Open your web browser and navigate to:

   > [https://mega.nz/folder/nQxinQZA#YTR33\_RAgW5PNK3yTuYVEQ](https://mega.nz/folder/nQxinQZA#YTR33_RAgW5PNK3yTuYVEQ)

2. Click **Download** (or **Download as ZIP**) to download the entire folder as a ZIP archive.

3. Wait for the download to complete.

## 2. Extract and Place Files

1. Locate the downloaded ZIP file (usually in your **Downloads** folder).
2. Right-click the ZIP file and choose **Extract All...** (or use your preferred extraction tool).
3. When prompted for the destination, select a folder named **OPM4EEG\_Project\_files** at the root of this repository:

   ```
   <path-to-your-repo>/OPM4EEG_Project_files/
   ```

   After extraction, the folder structure should resemble:

   ```plaintext
   OPM4EEG_Project_files/
   ├── OPM4EEG.zip
   └── (other files and folders)
   ```

## 3. Integrate into the Project

* Ensure the **OPM4EEG\_Project\_files** folder is located in the root of the cloned repository before running any scripts or the installer.
* The installer (`OPM4EEG_Approach_1_Installer.exe`) will automatically detect and include files from this directory.

## 4. External Files Contents

Inside **OPM4EEG\_Project\_files**, you will find:

* **OPM4EEG.zip** – the complete codebase, resources, and data.
* Additional documentation (PDFs, user guides), video tutorials, and installer executable.

## 5. Important Notes

* Do **not** rename or reorganize any files or folders, as scripts and the installer rely on fixed paths.
* If you need to update or replace files, extract them again into the same directory structure.

You are now ready to install and run the project using the provided installer or scripts. Good luck with your analysis and development!
